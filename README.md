# Udacity Master's in Artificial Intelligence – Project Workspace

This repository contains my work for the **Udacity/Woolf University Master’s in Artificial Intelligence** programme.  
All exercises, practice notebooks, and project submissions are organised by nanodegree and module.

The development workflow uses **Google Colab + GitHub**, avoiding the need for local installation while providing a clean, cloud-based environment for Python, data science, and AI experimentation.
