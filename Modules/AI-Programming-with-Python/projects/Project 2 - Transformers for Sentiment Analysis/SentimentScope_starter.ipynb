    "Now that we've outlined the structure and objectives of this project, let's delve into the core concept: sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. This can range from identifying the polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) of a review to analyzing emotions and opinions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, sentiment analysis is explicitly framed as a **binary classification task**, where the goal is to determine whether a given movie review is *positive* or *negative*. This task is central to many real-world applications, including customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and recommendation systems. By developing a transformer-based model, you will classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative to tackle the challenge faced by your entertainment company CineScope by enhancing its recommendation system, enabling more accurate and personalized suggestions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reviews labeled as positive will be marked as 1 in the dataset, while negative reviews will be labeled as 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following movie review:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"The movie was a rollercoaster of emotions, and I loved every moment of it!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This review is clearly positive as it expresses enjoyment and satisfaction with the movie, hence it will be labelled as *positive* or 1 in the dataset. In contrast:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"The plot was predictable, and the acting was subpar. A waste of time.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This review conveys a negative sentiment, criticizing both the plot and acting, hence it will be labelled as *negative* or 0 in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "While transformers are often used for generation tasks, they can also be adapted for classification tasks with some modifications to their architecture. You might already be familiar with the tweaks that we will implement in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this project is the [IMDB dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/), provided in the `aclIMDB_v1.tar.gz` file. Upon extracting the file, you will find the following folder structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "aclIMDB/\n",
    "├── train/\n",
    "│   ├── pos/    # Positive reviews for training\n",
    "│   ├── neg/    # Negative reviews for training\n",
    "│   ├── unsup/  # Unsupervised data (not used in this project)\n",
    "├── test/\n",
    "│   ├── pos/    # Positive reviews for testing\n",
    "│   ├── neg/    # Negative reviews for testing\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **train/**: Contains labeled data for training the model. Reviews in the `pos/` folder should be labeled as positive (1), while reviews in the `neg/` folder should be labeled as negative (0).\n",
    "- **test/**: Contains labeled data for evaluating the model. Similar to the training data, `pos/` and `neg/` contain positive and negative reviews, respectively.\n",
    "- **unsup/**: Contains unlabeled reviews that are not used in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the folder structure is crucial as it guides how we load and preprocess the data for the sentiment classification task.\n",

    "In earlier tasks, you might have encountered character-level tokenization, where each character in the text is treated as a token. While this is straightforward, it is less efficient and may result in larger input sizes, impacting the performance of transformer models.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we will use Hugging Face's `AutoTokenizer`, a robust and efficient class designed for tokenizing text based on pretrained models. Specifically, we will utilize the `bert-base-uncased` tokenizer, which applies **subword tokenization**. Subword tokenization involves two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Subword Splitting**: Words are split into smaller components (subwords) based on a predefined vocabulary. For example:\n",
    "   - Input: \"unhappiness\"\n",
    "   - Subword Splits: `['un', 'happiness']`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Token Conversion**: Each subword is then converted into a numerical token ID. For example:\n",
    "   - Subword Splits: `['un', 'happiness']`\n",
    "   - Token IDs: `[1011, 24123]` (values are illustrative and depend on the tokenizer vocabulary).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### About the `bert-base-uncased` Tokenizer\n",
    "The `bert-base-uncased` tokenizer, developed by Google researchers, is part of the BERT model family. This tokenizer is associated with the `bert-base-uncased` model, which has been widely used for tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering, and text classification. The tokenizer ensures all text is converted to lowercase and accents are removed, reducing vocabulary size and improving generalization. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input: \"I Love Transformers.\"\n",
    "- Subword Splits: `['i', 'love', 'trans', '##formers', '.']`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn more about the tokenizer and model on [Hugging Face's bert-base-uncased page](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using the `AutoTokenizer` Class\n",
    "The `AutoTokenizer` class in the Hugging Face Transformers library provides a seamless way to load tokenizers for various pretrained models. It automatically selects the correct tokenizer configuration based on the model name.\n"

    "   - Transformers output embeddings for each token in the input sequence. For classification, these token-level embeddings need to be condensed into a single vector.\n",

    "The function to calculate validation accuracy will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluate the model on the validation dataset.\n",
    "- Generate predictions for each batch.\n",
    "- Compare predictions with the true labels.\n",
    "- Compute the percentage of correctly classified examples.\n",

    "### 2.  Key Points\n",
    "- **Evaluation Mode**: Calling `model.eval()` ensures that dropout and other training-specific layers are disabled during evaluation.\n",
    "- **No Gradients**: The `torch.no_grad()` context disables gradient computation, reducing memory usage and speeding up validation.\n",
    "- **Predictions**: `torch.argmax(logits, dim=1)` retrieves the index of the highest logit for each sample, which corresponds to the predicted class label.\n",
    "- **Accuracy Calculation**: The function computes the fraction of correct predictions out of the total number of samples, then multiplies by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "After calculating the validation accuracy, incorporate this function into your training loop. Typically, you would call calculate_accuracy at the end of each epoch or after a specific number of training steps. Monitoring validation accuracy over time helps you track performance gains and identify potential overfitting or underfitting issues."

    "### Project Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I built a sentiment analysis model using a transformer architecture to classify IMDB movie reviews. I then started by loading and exploring the dataset, then prepared the data using a custom PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader. I used Hugging Face’s \"bert-base-uncased\" tokenizer and customized a transformer model for a classification task. The model was trained using labeled data and evaluated on unseen test data. After experimenting with different numbers of training epochs, the model finally achieved more than 75% accuracy on the test dataset when trained for 5 epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to training and evaluation, I also created a simple inference function (predict_sentiment) that allows the trained model to be used on new text inputs. I was able to pass in new movie reviews and receive sentiment predictions. This showed me how the model can be used beyond the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transformers can be used for classification tasks, not just for text generation.\n",
    "- Breaking the project into smaller steps made it easier to understand a complex model.\n",
    "- Seeing low accuracy at first does not always mean something is wrong, sometimes the model just needs more training time.\n",
    "- Understanding tensor shapes at each step helped reduce confusion when working with PyTorch.\n",
    "- Learning how to create a simple inference function helped connect the trained model to real-world usage."
