# From Day 16 onwards, you will be creating your own PyCharm projects from scratch.
# Instead of using templates that I have created for you.
# It will be another step in your journey as a developer!
# But don't worry, I will explain how to do everything in the video tutorials on Udemy.

# from turtle import Turtle, Screen

# timmy = Turtle()

# my_screen = Screen()

# print(my_screen.canvheight)
# timmy.shape("turtle")
# timmy.color("red")
# timmy.forward(100)

# my_screen.exitonclick()
