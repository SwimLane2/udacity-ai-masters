# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing? - Its counting values 1 to 19 
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"? - if the value reaches 20 it should print "You got it"
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i? - it never reaches 20 and so it does not enter the if statement.
