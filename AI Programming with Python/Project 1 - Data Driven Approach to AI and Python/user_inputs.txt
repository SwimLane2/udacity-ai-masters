Transformational AI: Analyzing Ecommerce Large Datasets for Machine Learning
Completed by: Arjun Avalakki Mohan

Question 1: The dataset contains customer reviews for electronics products. Each row represents one review with columns such as product ID, review text, rating, and reviewer information. The data includes text and numeric values and is structured in a tabular format that is easy to analyze using a pandas DataFrame.
Question 2: The output met my expectations. Using reviews_df.head() without print is easier to visualize because it renders a rich HTML table and clearly shows the top five rows. It also allows for quick inspection of the data. In comparison, the plain text output from print(reviews_df.head()) is harder to read due to wide text fields.
Question 3: We updated the pandas display settings and used the .head() method with a custom value of 10 to control how many rows are displayed. This allowed us to override the default output of five rows, making the data easier to inspect.
Question 4: The reviews dataset focuses on individual customer feedback, such as review text, ratings and reviewer information. However, the reviews metadata dataset contains product level information, including product titles, categories, prices, and overall ratings. The reviews dataset is mainly on user opinions, while the metadata dataset is about the products themselves.
Question 5: The .dtypes method was helpful for identifying the data type of each column, but the output was less structured and harder to read when working with many columns. However, the .info() method stood out because the output clearly showed the number of rows, column names, data types, non-null counts, and memory usage in one structured summary, making it much easier to understand the dataset.
Question 6: Based on the graph, most highly rated products are in the lower price range, and the number of products decreases as the price increases. Only a small number of expensive products appear, which shows that high ratings are more common among cheaper items.
Question 7: The scatterplot shows that high ratings are more common among lower priced products. As prices increase, the number of highly rated products decreases, and there is no clear trend showing that higher prices result in higher ratings. Overall, customers tend to give high ratings to affordable products, and paying more does not guarantee better reviews.
